📊 Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether an employee will leave (attrition) using the Kaggle HR Employee Attrition dataset.
A Random Forest Classifier was used to build the model, achieving an accuracy of 87%.

🚀 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations. Predicting which employees are at risk helps HR teams take proactive steps to improve retention.

This project covers the full end-to-end ML pipeline:
Data loading & cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Preprocessing (label encoding, one-hot encoding, scaling)
Model training using Random Forest
Model evaluation
Extracting & visualizing feature importance
